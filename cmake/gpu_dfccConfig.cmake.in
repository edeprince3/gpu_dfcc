# gpu_dfccConfig.cmake
# -----------------------
#
# gpu_dfcc cmake module.
# This module sets the following variables in your project::
#
#   gpu_dfcc_FOUND - true if gpu_dfcc and all required components found on the system
#   gpu_dfcc_VERSION - gpu_dfcc version in format Major.Minor.Release
#   gpu_dfcc_LIBRARIES - gpu_dfcc library to link against.
#   gpu_dfcc_LIBRARY - same as LIBRARIES
#
#
# Available components: None
#
#
# Exported targets::
#
# If gpu_dfcc is found, this module defines the following :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED`
# target. ::
#
#   gpu_dfcc::gpu_dfcc - the main gpu_dfcc library
#
#
# Suggested usage::
#
#   find_package(gpu_dfcc)
#   find_package(gpu_dfcc 0.5 EXACT CONFIG REQUIRED)
#
#
# The following variables can be set to guide the search for this package::
#
#   gpu_dfcc_DIR - CMake variable, set to directory containing this Config file
#   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH - CMake variable, set to root directory of this package
##   PATH - environment variable, set to bin directory of this package
#   CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_gpu_dfcc - CMake variable, disables
#     find_package(gpu_dfcc) when not REQUIRED, perhaps to force internal build
